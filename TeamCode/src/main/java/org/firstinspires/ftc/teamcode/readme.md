## This is where most of our code is

## Commands

we keep all of our Enums in this folder as a "State," to use when our bot is doing something specific

## TeleOp 

all of our subsystem code working together here

## Roadrunner

our autonomous profiles that we launch based on which side and team we're playing on

## Subsystems

where we keep all the code for separate pieces of hardware so it's nice and organized and accessible
